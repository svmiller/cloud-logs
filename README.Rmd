# A Summary of Daily Cloud Syncs

This is a silly project of mine to track/automate my daily work activity and
syncs to my cloud storage. You can [read a bit more about my setup here](https://svmiller.com/blog/2025/05/cloud-storage-european-style/). 
Every day, I sync my main cloud storage to a backup cloud provider and log the
files transferred, the total size of files transferred, and the time elapsed to
sync my main cloud storage provider to my backup. This script and repository
gathers the last two measures and formats them for presentation. I have an
automated procedure that does this every morning and uploads to Github.

## Time Elapsed Syncing to Cloud, Daily

## Summary of Past 14 Days

  tail(14) %>%
  select(date, transfer, elapsed)
